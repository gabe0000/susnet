# 2025-12-12 — Session 1

## What happened
- Added Meshtastic channel prefs/profiles API (stored at /var/lib/susnet/meshtastic_prefs.json) and restarted susnet-api.
- Updated Meshtastic listener to log channel names when available, include them in messages.json, and honor per-channel TTS mute/solo flags; restarted meshtastic-listener.
- Refreshed private UI and deployed to /opt/susnet-api/susnet_index.html: channel gear for mute/solo msg/TTS, persisted via API, nicknames/notes stored via API and used in message list; AllStar nodes list now prioritizes 66190 and 531121.

## Next
- Surface channel prefs state in UI without prompts and add backend enforcement for TTS when channel names are missing in packets.
- Sync channel/nickname prefs across devices (currently stored server-side via API).
