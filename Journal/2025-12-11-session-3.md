# 2025-12-11 — Session 3

## What happened
- Locked down the public GitHub repo to docs only (BuildFiles, Troubleshooting, Journal, README, sample UI). Force-pushed cleaned history to keep code private.
- Tweaked Meshtastic listener: only announce direct messages to our node; broadcasts require ANNOUNCE_BROADCAST=1. Restarted listener.
- Reworked private Meshtastic UI (local only): per-channel filters (DM/MQTT/RF/Hide NC Mesh), channel prefs (mute/solo flags), nicknames + notes per favorite node, and a profiles section. AllStar nodes list now prioritizes 66190 and 531121.

## Next
- Add backend/API support for Meshtastic channel prefs so TTS honors mute/solo flags server-side.
- Expose UI toggle for ANNOUNCE_BROADCAST and per-channel announce rules.
- Keep refining BuildFiles/ReplicationGuide with the new UI/TTS model.
