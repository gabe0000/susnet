# 2025-12-11 (Consolidated)

**Recap**
- Docs cleanup: kept `README.md` as the single public overview, removed the duplicate narrative file, and clarified AURSINC (half-radio/half-soundcard UHF hotspots) plus AOIC/K1 usage.
- UI preview: added `Sample_User_Interface.html`, a static backend-free demo that anyone can download and open locally to see the live layout without exposing services.
- Journal structure: moved journals to top-level `Journal/` with one file per entry; consolidating today’s multiple notes into this single entry.
- Git hygiene: resolved PAT push issues, removed public `.gitignore` (kept local excludes in `.git/info/exclude` for the push helper), and kept the repo focused on docs/UI samples only.

**What changed in the repo**
- `README.md` now points to the static UI demo and reflects the top-level journal location.
- `Sample_User_Interface.html` added as the safe UI preview.
- Journals are now under `Journal/` (per-entry files); previous 2025-12-11 fragments are merged here.

**Action items**
- Draft MQTT topic map and decide which Pi (voice vs. data) will host the web UI after the split.
- Prototype Dire Wolf on a dedicated dongle/radio for APRS packets (avoid sharing with AllStar voice).
- Flesh out `ReplicationGuide.md` with wiring diagrams (AURSINC, AOIC/K1) and systemd/service configs.
- Consider switching Git auth to SSH keys to avoid PAT handling in the shell.
