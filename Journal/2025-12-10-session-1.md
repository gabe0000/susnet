**Wins**
- Captured a full technical narrative about “the box,” covering AllStar, GMRShub, APRS, Meshtastic, AOIC, and DVSwitch integration points.
- Clarified control paths (browser UI vs. DTMF) and the under-construction text-to-speech idea for APRS/Meshtastic traffic.

**Losses / Blockers**
- Documentation lived only in ad-hoc notes, so there was no structured place to track experiments or lessons.
- Git wasn’t initialized, meaning no history or backups for the growing explanation.

**Lessons / Next Steps**
- Need a repeatable framework (now BuildFiles) to capture designs, troubleshooting steps, and future upgrades.
- Establishing Git early prevents second-guessing when sharing files or rolling back.
- Follow-up: build the doc scaffolding (done on 2025-12-11) and keep daily updates going.
