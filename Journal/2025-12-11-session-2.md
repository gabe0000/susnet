# 2025-12-11 (late)

**Recap**
- Added a support/ticket system: API endpoints (`/api/tickets` create/list/close) and dashboard UI modal with "Create Support Ticket" and open-ticket list + close button.
- Reorganized troubleshooting into top-level `Troubleshooting/` with master log, open/closed folders, and ticket numbers starting at TKT-1000.
- Cleaned up docs references (README points to Troubleshooting at top level; old stub removed).
- Kept tickets UI scoped to open items only; closed tickets can be viewed in the repo as needed.

**Action items**
- Keep journal entries in one per day with meaningful commit messages.
- Flesh out `ReplicationGuide.md` with wiring (AURSINC, AOIC/K1) and service configs.
- Draft MQTT topic map and decide which Pi hosts the web UI after voice/data split.
- Consider SSH key auth to replace PAT handling.
