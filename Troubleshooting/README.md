# Troubleshooting Folder

- `master.md`: status of all tickets (open/closed) and workflow.
- `open/`: individual ticket files (`TKT-XXXX.md`) currently being worked.
- `closed/`: resolved ticket files.

Ticket numbers start at 1000. When opening a new ticket, create `TKT-XXXX.md` in `open/`, then move it to `closed/` once resolved and update `master.md`.
