## Summary
Some modules wider than others. Makes scrolling require side scrolls and zooming in and out. Need to be dynamic for whichever device.

## Resolution
(pending)

## Follow-up
- (add next steps here)

## Closure (2025-12-11)
Resolution: Layout tightened for mobile (panels/fields min-width zero, body overflow-x hidden) to stop side-scroll.
Follow-up: Re-check on phone width; report if any module still overflows.
