# TKT-1005 - Ticket pop up scrolls weird

- Date opened: 2025-12-11
- Date closed: 2025-12-11
- Subsystem: Support
- Severity: Medium
- Status: closed

## Summary
Popup should just be centered and in front of everything. The map covers it as you scroll now. Main page scrolling should be disabled if I’m touching anywhere inside the support ticket window.

## Resolution
(pending)

## Follow-up
- (add next steps here)

## Closure (2025-12-11)
Resolution: Ticket modal centers above page with body scroll locked while open (higher z-index, taller box).
Follow-up: Confirm modal stays put on scroll/drag.
